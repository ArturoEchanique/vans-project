    "Built at the request of Chrysler executive Virgil Exner, the Gilda was an exercise in extreme styling and ambitious performance. It was created by Ghia and debuted as a show car at the Salone di Torino of 1955, later touring around Europe, then the US. The car was nicknamed after Rita Hayworth’s performance in the 1946 film noir classic “Gilda”. It has been called “one of the ten most significant show cars” by Strother MacMinn.Fabrication of the Gilda was completed to the same standards of other Ghia coachwork for Italian chassis such as Ferrari and Maserati.But unlike the cars produced for wealthy clients, the Steamline’s shape was one of Ghia’s most spectacular.",
    "“The fastest car on water and the fastest boat on the road”, the Amphicar Model 700 was unveiled at the 1961 New York Auto Show and would go on to see a production run of 4 years.The Model 700 was built by the Quandt Group in West Germany and marketed primarily in the United States. Its amphibious architecture was based on the Volkswagen Schwimmwagen; a military vehicle used to traverse aquatic terrain during World War II.",
    "Three wheels – one in the front, two in the rear. This ladies and gentlemen, is the Reliant Robin. A tribute to Dr. Seuss, both in name and demeanor, this 3-wheeled vehicle still managed to be mildly successful from a business standpoint – so much so that it remained on the production line until as recent as 2002.The Robin is proof that even the most modest of vehicles can be commercially successful when it properly caters to its market.For one, it was affordable.Very affordable.",
    "Momentum behind the style was structured by a design concept of incorporating Electron, an alloy of magnesium and aluminum from IG Farben of Germany, in the design. Though it is strong, and up to one third the weight of aluminum, it is also highly flammable thus welding was not possible. This meant that each panel had to be riveted into place which posed a particular problem for traditional design. Therefore, Jean incorporated the rivet’s aesthetic into the wings of the car and created a telling combination of function and form.",
    "Today, the cars’ smooth shape is still as pleasing to the eye as it was in 1948. The buoy is long and low with a complete underbelly panel. With the engine occupying the rear of the chassis, the cockpit is pushed forward. In keeping with the aerofoil shape, no doors are cut out of the body. A large one-piece rear panel opens hydraulically to reveal the entire rear end of the chassis.The car was based around a 1947 Buick “Super 8” engine which powered the 2200 lb car to 120 mph.The main chassis was built up from five - inch steel tubes which kicked up over the rear axle.To offer a smooth ride, a modified 1947 Ford suspension was utilized.",
    "Lightweight expression is one main theme of the Aérodyne. Examples of this can be seen in the slender fenders which required support struts, an open cockpit and small headlight surrounds.Another focus of the car is the retractable roof which shapes the entire fastback roofline and closes directly onto the top of the windshield.The unit is pneumatic and relies on a twin - cylinder suction engine that is mounted in the trunk.Operation of top is slow, but nearly silent.Several windows were put into the sunroof to provide rearward vision at various positions.",
    "Like many cars on this list, the 1956 Buick Centurion was a car that provided a glimpse into the future. A spectacular four-passenger coupe with a fiberglass body and an all-glass “panoramic roof”, the red and white Centurion dream car, notably equipped with a television camera mounted in the trunk.A receiver on the instrument panel displayed images from the camera, thereby rendering the rearview mirror obsolete – the very first concept of the back - up camera, if you will.The camera was also mounted in a tail - cone inspired by a jet fighter, a recurring theme in concept cars of the ’50s.",
    "Eat your heart out Tesla. L’Oeuf Electrique, literally ‘the electric egg,’ was built by French artist, designer, and engineer Paul Arzens in 1942 for personal use. While contemporary Elon Musk can duly take credit for bringing electric cars to the mass market, his EV product is neither proprietary nor the first to hit the road.With a 60 - mile range and a 37 mph top speed, the egg was the ultimate urban vehicle years before the first electric Smart ForTwo took to the streets and more than half a century before EVs had any sort of mass - production credibility.",
    "The 1953 XP-21 Firebird 1 is remarkable and very easily differentiated from just about anything else designed for the road. Though it resembles a jet airplane, its styling was more a nod to inspiration rather than to practical engineering design principles.Its primary purpose was actually an exercise in determining whether a gas turbine engine could be used as a viable powerplant for production vehicles; the aptly named ‘Whirlfire Turbo - Power’ engine jet - propelled the Firebird 1 via its rear wheels and a transmission.",
    "The flagship Turbo S generates up to 750 hp and accelerates from zero to 100 km/h in just 2.8 seconds and a top speed of 260 km/h. Its 93.4 kWh liquid-cooled lithium-ion gives it a range of up to 412 km.Currently available in three trims(4S, Turbo and Turbo S), the Taycan will be made available in additional trims and variants over the lifespan of the model.",
    "The original Tesla Roadster was unveiled in 2007, boasting a top speed of more than 130 mph, a range of 250 miles on a single charge and a 0-60 mph time of about four seconds. Its brief production run from 2008-2012 would set the foundation on which Tesla would proliferate its product to the mass-market via the Model S, Model X and Model 3.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has confirmed a return of the Roadster to the line - up, equipped with vast improvements over the first iteration.Time has been kind to the Roadster in this sense, as it looks to benefit from nearly a decade of additional R & D.",
    "As a precursor to the legendary Stratos HF rally car, Bertone built this one-off prototype for the 1970 Turin Motor Show. Its dramatic wedge shape had a profound effect on later automotive design including many of Bertone’s later cars for Lamborghini and Alfa Romeo. It rivaled the Ferrari Modulo which was also revealed at the Turin show by Pininfarina.This remarkable car was the work of Marcello Gandini at Bertone.With its space - inspired lines, Nuccio Bertone was initially going to call the car the Stratolimite before the final name was chosen.The wedge shape preceded the Stratos by two years when Bertone launched the Alfa Romeo Carabo in 1968.",
    "If there was ever a car that could define an entire generation, it would have to be the Delorean DMC-12. Its peculiarly desirable silhouette – with a blend of both futuristic and retro looks – would go on to catapult it to cult status as one of the co-stars of the Back to the Future movie series.Through the scope of being an actual automobile, there is nothing particularly desirable or outstanding about it.Its 130 hp engine could only propel the car from 0 - 60 mph in just under 10 seconds, which makes you wonder how Marty McFly even got up to the 88 mph needed to traverse the flow of time.",
    "Publishing this list was basically put on hold just so that we could include this car. Gordon Murray – famed designer of the McLaren F1 – has sought to reintroduce a driver-focused car in an era where computers and fancy electronics ultimately determine how a car is allowed to be driven.What this means is that the new GMD T.50 is a hyper car that does things differently from the others.For starters – besides its 12, 100 rpm red line – there is nothing that stands out from the car as far as specs go.",
    "SUVs are very popular right now in the UK, so you'll be pleased to know that £200 per month will secure you a modern, stylish, efficient and practical Kia Sportage.Undoubtedly one of the best things about Kia cars is the 7 year warranty that they come with from new, meaning that three year old cars that are well within budget will still have four years manufacturer cover against mechanical faults.",
    "The C-MAX and its bigger, seven-seat brother, the Grand C-MAX, are both available with a £200 monthly budget, which will secure you either a mid-spec latest generation model or a super-high spec older car.Practicality is the car's main purpose, and the shape of the C-MAX certainly accommodates that, with lots of interior room for passengers and a big boot. Diesel models were popular when the car was new, but petrol EcoBoost versions will get you around town just fine. ",
    "The Qashqai was always ahead of its time, and because the latest generation was packed with tech from the start, even the three year old ones (plenty of which can be found for under £200 a month) will have all of the modern gadgets and gizmos. Need something smaller? Try the Nissan Juke, which also is in budget. ",
    "It will likely be one of the smaller-engined diesel or petrol models but that just means it'll be better on fuel. Spec-wise, because of their premium nature, a BMW 3 Series will always have a decent level of kit.You can also pick up a 1 Series for this money too, if you don't need saloon-car levels of practicality. ",
    "Now we're talking! A sporty convertible with a premium badge for under £200 per month? Absolutely - The MINI Convertible is exactly that, and while there are also plenty of MINI Hatchbacks at this price point, there are lots of reasons to go for the convertible instead.That wind -in -your hair feeling is only a button - push away thanks to an electric folding roof, and the Convertible retains all of the fun - to - drive characteristics of the classic Hatchback model.",
    "It's a crossover between a hatchback and an SUV, and as such the driving experience and economy figures are equivalent to that of a family hatch, but the increased ride height gives you a better view of the road ahead.You can get yourself into a two or three year old petrol or diesel Mokka X with air con, alloys and plenty more besides for the budget.Other Vauxhalls you can pick up for under £200 per month include the Astra, Corsa and Insignia hatchbacks.",
    "A three or four year old Passat at this price point makes all kinds of sense as a used buy because they are high-spec, good-looking cars that can munch the miles on the motorway with ease.The vast majority of the used Passats for sale will be diesel cars, with this version finding favour with new car buyers because of its refined - yet - punchy performance and excellent fuel economy.",
    "For a car finance payment of less than £200, you can score a two or three year old Leon that will still be bang up to date in terms of its looks, tech and driving experience.Diesel variants were very popular with new car buyers and as such there are plenty of those around for bargain prices on the used market, but if you don't do high mileage then you may be better off with a petrol. The Leon's smaller brother, the Ibiza, can also be financed for under £200 per month.",
    "Nowadays you can pick up a 2013-onwards A-Class (the more stylish hatchback model, as oppose to the older-generation MPV-style car) for under £200 per month fairly easily.A180 models are available as both petrol or diesel variants, with the petrol a bit quicker and the diesel a bit better on fuel, so it depends what's more important to you. SE models were the base spec, with Sport, Sport Premium and AMG Line models giving you sportier styling and more tech",
    "The A1 is a great little car for those who are after a premium badge without the additional size. It offers many of the luxury features of a bigger premium car such as a comfortable ride, excellent build quality and a selection of refined engines.Available as both a 3 - door and 5 - door(Audi call this version a Sportback) interior room is more plentiful than you might imagine for a car of this size, with a boot that can accommodate a pushchair.",
